    "changelog": "### Fixed\r\n- Resolved an issue where Symmetric Projection was defaulting to off, not taking advantage of potential GPU perf gains\r\n- Changed Symmetric Projection and Subsampled Layout settings incompatibilities to be build warnings rather than errors since these aren't fatal settings issues\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n- `Unity.XR.Oculus.Stats.PerfMetrics` entries currently return `0` when using the OpenXR runtime, which is the default in the 2.x and 3.x versions of the Oculus XR Plugin package\r\n- `Unity.XR.Oculus.Stats.AppMetrics` entries currently return `0` on all Oculus runtimes\r\n- For both of the above, the suggested replacement is to use the profiling tools available via the Oculus Developer Hub: https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/ts-odh-logs-metrics/"
